# Getting Started
___

This was a project I followed along with for the [Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex)](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/learn/v4/overview) course on Udemy.

> ### 1. Clone the repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bbcharlton/Vue_Monster_Project.git
```

> ### 2. Open index.html

Open the `index.html` file in your browser. The page should load a simple application where you fight against a monster. You can heal, attack, or give up.
